# Bug List

1. Problem: The hitbox for the models are weird.
    I Fixed it! It was only really the doors, and that was because
    the div used to center the buttons you turn the screen with was
    blocking the canvas from being clicked.

2. Most of the models are wonky. Especially their scale.
