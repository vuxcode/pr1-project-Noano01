REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Notes

> You can use this section of the file to keep notes about your project as you work on it.

# Project Summary

> This is a simple puzzle game, where you try to find keys to escape rooms.
> It is really short and really simple.

> If I were to use one word to describe this experience, it would be "hectic".
> I more or less saved the biggest and most difficult parts until the last week, which became a bit stressful.
> But other than that it was fun.

>There are lots of things I wish I had time to implement, such as a map of the level, some file format for rooms so you don't need >to hardcode them, an actual inventory, more complicated camera angles, some actual puzzles, amongst other things.

> I did suprisingly manage to stick pretty close to the budget, but that is mainly because I had to scale down most of the features.
> Adding all the features I wanted would have taken at least 10 more hours.

# User Guide

> This project is written using modules. Models require the webpage to be hosted by a server, and not just opened from explorer.
> I recomend using an extension for VS code to make this as painless as posible, such as [this one.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
